            My favorite song is The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel. It's a classic folk rock song 
            from the 1960s. The original version of the song was just acoustic guitar and vocals. The song didn't 
            become popular until a radio dj created a new version of the song which added electric guitar, drums, 
            and bass to the original recording.

            My favorite movie is La La Land. It was directed by Damien Chazelle, who also directed Whiplash and
            Babylon. This movie is a musical, but it doesn't let the musical numbers distract from allowing the
            characters to develop in interesting ways. Furthermore, many of the best musical scenes in the movie
            have no vocals, and instead rely on the score and the visuals to tell the story.
