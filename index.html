        <h4>Bandana's</h4>
        <p>
            This is my favorite restaurant because it's the <b>best barbecue restaurant</b> around for the price. 
            While the sides do leave something to be desired, their smoked meats <b>more than make up for it</b>. 
            My family eats there just about any time we're in St. Joe.
